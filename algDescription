Alg Description

Oranization
The manager will be written in go. All heavy computation will be handled by the pre compiled program.
	The manager will send messages, via OSC to the max manager which will then parse these messages to handle all nessisary dsp. 
		Video will be captured from inside Max using jitter, and sent for computation to the go manager.

		All video effects processing will be done via jitter/gen in max.

This entire project, from start to finish, will be put on Github to keep with my open source ethos. The status and progress of the project can be checked upon by visiting
